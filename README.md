Staff Sit is a staff system that uses Buckets (Game Instances) to allow staff to do staff sits without being interrupted by players. 

Usage: 

/setbucket (bucketid) This is used to transfer yourself to a bucket. Uses include being called by a lower staff member to assist with a staff sit. EX: /setbucket 2

/staffsit (id's) This is used to start a new staff sit with the specified players and teleports all specified server id's to the same bucket. EX: /staffsit 1 2 3 4

/resetbuckets (id's) This is used to reset the specified players buckets back to 0 (Default game instance), Useful for when a staffsit is over. EX: /staffsit 1 2 3 4

This script uses discord id's from badgers scripts to read your discord roles and allow the specified roles to use the command.

This script is standalone. (We are working on using QB-Target to select the players you want with third eye to start a staff sit.
